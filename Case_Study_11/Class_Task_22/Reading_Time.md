Spark can be easier to use than Hadoop. It's also potentially much faster.

hdfs
mapreduce: software works on the nodes where the data is located.

"Math is deductive logic. The logic of data analysis
applied to disciplines like astrophysics and power engineering
is inductive, which is very, very different. To be sure,
math is a critical tool in this inductive logic, but the top
level process is inductive, requiring a host of stages like
empirical validation of derived theories, and the replication
of experimental findings by different groups. It is better that
students see the inductive logic at work through involvement
in data analysis, and learn only the math that is useful
for this"

"Scholar is for the technical community and Web for the
general population. Our world is the former; we are a lot
better off where it counts."

## [Python For Finance](https://books.google.com/books/about/Python_for_Finance.html?id=7tzSBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q&f=false)

The book introduces Python for someone who knows nothing about it.
It helps them begin learning how to use it.
Here are some things I pulled from it that I thought could be useful:

####Libraries/Packages:

BitArray </br>
Cubes OLAP </br>
Disco </br>
Gdata </br>
h5py </br>
HDFS </br>
IPython </br>
lxml </br>
matplotlib </br>
MPI4Py </br>
MPICH2 </br>
NetworkX </br>
numexpr </br>
MumPy </br>
pandas (see also pandas.io.data) </br>
PyTables </br>
SciPy </br>
Scikit-Learn </br>
Spyder - This one is aparently good to look into. </br>
statsmodels </br>
SymPy </br>
Theano </br>
 </br>



#### Platorms and Formats
lookup Python Quant Platform </br>
https://www.qt.io </br>
You can have Python markdowns and LaTeX is supported. Look up Notebook </br>
Obviously you can just use python in the shell.
