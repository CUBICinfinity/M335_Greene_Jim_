A: you might not know everything, but you can pay as much attention as you can do what you are putting in and getting out and how it is functioning as far as it is possible.

If the data scientist’s goal is to create automated processes that affect people’s lives, then he or she should regularly consider ethics in a way that academics in computer science and statistics, generally speaking, do not.

You may want to show it with and without. It can give you a good insight about how we are serving people.
