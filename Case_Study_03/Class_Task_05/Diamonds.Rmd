This graph combines each of the 4 features of diamonds. I represented them in almost the messiest ways I could.


```{r, include=F, eval=F}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  #theme_dark()
  geom_hline(yintercept = 2000, color = "white", size = 1.25) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1800, color = "white", size = 1.125) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1600, color = "white", size = 1.125) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1400, color = "white", size = 1.125) +

  labs(x = "Carat Weight", y = "Price", color = "Clarity", title = "Diamond Prices")
ggsave("Case_Study_03/Class_Task_05/better.png", width = 12, height = 12)
```

I chose to leave out color and cut. Color is about as significant in pricing as clarity, so a second graph for color would be worth observing. Cut doesn't affect price as significantly as the others.
I adjusted the scales to focus on his budget. I also stretched the axis scales logarithmically. I altered the transperency and made the legend a little bit neater. I also added thicker girdlines to identify $100 increments.
