### Background

The NYCflights13::flights dataset contains all flights departing from NYC airports in 2013 (See R Documentation). </br>
In this analysis I address two questions: </br>

#### If one is leaving before noon, which two airlines would I recommend at each airport (JFK, LGA, EWR) that will have the lowest delay time at the 75th percentile?

Based on the 75th percentiles, for EWR, I reccommend Endeavor (9E) or US Airways (US); </br>
for JFK, I reccomend Delta (DL) or American Airlines (AA); </br>
and for LGA, US Airways or American Airlines.

This table shows the delays in minutes for each airline (carrier) at the 75th percentile. Negative values indicate that the plane arrived early.



<center>

```r
JFK_delay <- filter(flights, sched_dep_time < 1200 & origin == "JFK") %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(JFK = quantile(dep_delay, probs = .75, na.rm = T))

LGA_delay <- filter(flights, sched_dep_time < 1200 & origin == "LGA") %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(LGA = quantile(dep_delay, probs = .75, na.rm = T))
  
EWR_delay <- filter(flights, sched_dep_time < 1200 & origin == "EWR") %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(EWR = quantile(dep_delay, probs = .75, na.rm = T))

delay <- suppressMessages(plyr::join(EWR_delay, JFK_delay, type = "right"))
delay <- suppressMessages(plyr::join(delay, LGA_delay,  type = "right"))
pander(delay)
```

This plot show the distributions of delays for each carrier.


```r

  ggplot() +
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(carrier, dep_delay), fill = "#000050", color = "#000050") +
  facet_wrap( ~ origin, ncol = 1, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(x = "Carrier", y = "Departure Delays") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-20, 100)) +

#### Which destination airport is the worst airport for arrival time?

The two worst are Cincinnati Northern Kentucky (CVG) and Key West (EYW), based on the probability of arriving late:

<center>

```r
chance <- filter(flights, carrier == "DL" & dest != "JAC" & dest != "JAX" & dest != "PHL" & dest != "STL" & dest != "DCA" & dest != "OMA" & dest != "IND" & dest != "BNA") %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(prob = mean(arr_delay > 2, na.rm = T))
#chance$`Probability of arriving later than 2 minutes` <- reorder(chance$`Probability of arriving later than 2 minutes`)
chance <- arrange(chance, prob)
colnames(chance) <- c("Destination", "Probability of arriving more than 2 minutes behind schedule")
pander(tail(chance, 10))
```
